# Why am I doing this?
	* Understanding :

	* Academic improvement : As for my first year in Bsc Cybersecurity,
		we need to know the fundamentals of data structures. It is not
		a requirement to code the data structures for my course yet I 
		find better understanding when applying the theory into code.
 
	* Curosity: Learning new content is fun :) 

	* Real World Application: By building up these fundamentals, it will
		allow me to create complex programmes for the future.
